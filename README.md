- Data augmentation to improve model performance
- Save and load model weights for future inference
- Visualizations of training progress

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is the [Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data), which contains 25,000 images of cats and dogs. You will need to download the dataset and organize it into training and validation directories as follows:


## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional for image processing)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python

Usages

1.Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cat-v-dog-classification.git
cd cat-v-dog-classification

2.Place your dataset in the correct directory structure as mentioned above.
3.Open the Jupyter Notebook in this repository and run the cells to train the model.

Training the Model
The training process involves the following steps:

Data loading and preprocessing.
Building the CNN architecture.
Compiling the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function.
Training the model on the training dataset while validating on the validation dataset.
Adjust the hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs as needed.

Results
After training, the model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss. The training and validation accuracy/loss can be visualized using Matplotlib.
