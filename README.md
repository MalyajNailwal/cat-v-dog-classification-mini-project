# Cat vs. Dog Classification Mini Project

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The objective is to build an accurate model that can distinguish between these two categories using a dataset of labeled images. This project serves as a practical introduction to deep learning and image classification.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies images into 'cat' or 'dog' categories.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances the training dataset to improve model generalization.
- **Visualizations**: Provides insights into model performance through accuracy and loss graphs.
- **User-Friendly Implementation**: Easy to understand and modify for customization.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional for image processing)

## Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MalyajNailwal/cat-v-dog-classification-mini-project.git
   cd cat-v-dog-classification-mini-project
   ```

2. Download the dataset and organize the images into training and validation directories.

   ```
   data/
       train/
           cats/
           dogs/
       validation/
           cats/
           dogs/
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in the repository and run the cells to train the model.

4. After training, test the model with new images to see predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model can be sourced from:

- [Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data), which contains 25,000 images of cats and dogs.
- Ensure to preprocess and split the dataset correctly into training and validation sets.

## Model Architecture

The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which includes:

- **Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction from images.
- **Pooling Layers**: To reduce dimensionality and enhance feature representation.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification based on the features extracted.

The architecture is customizable, allowing for experimentation with different hyperparameters and layers.

## Results

The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss. Visualizations of training and validation accuracy/loss will help assess the model's learning process.

Example results include:

- Training and validation accuracy/loss curves.
- Confusion matrix to visualize the classification performance.
